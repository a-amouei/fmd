TO-DO:

  #1    Review fmd_bond_apply()
  #2    Write a function to update the field 'distances' in molkind_t
  #3    Write a function to add molecule instances to the simulation box
  #4    Add the ability to save bond data into VTF files (to view molecules with VMD)
  #5    Check logic of fmd_box_setSize()

Questions:

  #1    Q: In fmd_pot_prepareForForceComp() at potential.c, can fmd_list_find_custom()
        be replaced with fmd_list_find()?

        A: My first guess is that it can be done. But maybe needs more analysis.

  #2    Q: Can LocalID be finally removed from mol_atom_neighbor_t?
