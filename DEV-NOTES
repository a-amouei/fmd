TO-DO:

  #1    Review fmd_bond_apply()
  #2    Write a function to update the field 'distances' in molkind_t
  #3    Write a function to add molecule instances to the simulation box
  #4    Add the ability to save bond data into VTF files (to view molecules with VMD)
  #5    Check logic of fmd_box_setSize()
  #6    Now that arrays are used instead of linked-lists to store particles, if an atom of a molecule leaves a grid cell and enters another 
        cell or if its place in a cell is changed, the references to it in the data structures of the neighbor atoms must be updated.
  #7    In md_ghost.c, only data of atoms belonging to the active group should be communicated.

Questions:

  #1    Q: In fmd_pot_prepareForForceComp() at potential.c, can fmd_list_find_custom()
        be replaced with fmd_list_find()?

        A: My first guess is that it can be done. But maybe needs more analysis.

  #2    Q: Can LocalID be finally removed from mol_atom_neighbor_t?
