TO-DO:

  #1          Review fmd_bond_apply()
  
  #2          Write a function to update the field 'distances' in molkind_t
  
  #3          Write a function to add molecule instances to the simulation box
  
  #4          Add the ability to save bond data into VTF files (to view molecules with VMD)
  
  #5          Check logic of fmd_box_setSize()
  
  #6          Now that arrays are used instead of linked-lists to store particles, if an atom of a molecule leaves a grid cell and
              enters another cell or if its place in a cell is changed, the references to it in the data structures of the neighbor
              atoms of the same molecue must be updated.
              
  #7          In md_ghost.c, only data of atoms belonging to the active group should be communicated.
  
  #8          See how much -ffast-math and -fomit-frame-pointer compiler options affect the performance.
  
  #9          In ttm_type1_solve_1d() of ttm.c, a call to _fmd_turi_update_ghosts_1d() once appears before the time loop and
              once inside the loop just before its end brace. At both, the function transfers the values of FMD_FIELD_NUMBER and
              FMD_FIELD_TTM_TE fields to be filled in ghost turi-cells, using packer/unpacker functions type1_1d_pack() and
              type1_1d_unpack() (which are defined inside ttm.c). Since inside the mentioned time loop the FMD_FIELD_NUMBER field is
              constant, _fmd_turi_update_ghosts_1d() when is called from within the loop should not transfer values of the 
              FMD_FIELD_NUMBER field.

Questions:

  #1          Q: In fmd_pot_prepareForForceComp() at potential.c, can fmd_list_find_custom() be replaced with fmd_list_find()?

              A: My first guess is that it can be done. But maybe needs more analysis.

  #2          Q: Can LocalID be finally removed from mol_atom_neighbor_t?

Remarks:

  #1[CLOSED]  Since MPI_BYTE is used to transmit structs, currently the code may not be portable to heterogeneous machines.
  
  #2[CLOSED]  In matter.c, the function _fmd_compute_GroupTemperature_etc_localgrid() computes GroupMomentum, but the function
              calculate_GroupTemperature_etc() doesn't. This is not a problem at the moment, because there is no function in the
              library interface reporting the momentum.
