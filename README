FMD - a classical molecular dynamics library

1) About FMD
============

Free Molecular Dynamics (FMD) is a library for performing classical
molecular dynamics (MD) simulations on different kinds of computers,
from personal computers to computer clusters. It is written in C.

FMD is a growing project. At the moment, its features and capabilities
include:

- can be run on personal computers, workstations, clusters and
supercomputers
   * uses MPI for distributed-memory message-passing parallelism
   * uses OpenMP for shared-memory parallelism
- can save atomic coordinates in XYZ [1], VTF [2] and CSV [3] formats
- supports EAM, Morse, and Lennard-Jones potentials
- provides Berendsen thermostat
- provides microcanonical NVE ensemble
- can save checkpoints for continuing a simulation
- ...

2) Installation
===============

FMD depends on

- an MPI implementation (e.g. OpenMPI or MPICH)
- GNU Scientific Library
- HDF5

To install FMD on Linux, open a terminal and change the current directory
to "src". Then simply enter the following command:

$ make install

It can aslo be uninstalled by

$ make uninstall

3) The examples
===============

The example C programs in the "examples" directory show how to use FMD
in practice. They could be seen as a good starting point for getting
acquainted with FMD. The program files include the instructions needed
for compiling and/or running the examples and contain good amount of
comments to show what the purpose of each line is.

4) Where to get more information
================================

Documentation file(s) will gradually be developed in the "doc" directory.

We welcome questions and comments! If you would like to ask any question
related to this project, see the file "AUTHORS" for contact information.
